# Face Mask Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a face mask detection system using machine learning (ML) techniques. The system is designed to identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in images.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python
```

## Dataset

Collect a dataset of images with two classes: one with people wearing masks and another without masks. Ensure the dataset is well-balanced to achieve better model performance.

## Model

The face mask detection model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture is defined in the [model.py](model.py) file.

## Training

1. Prepare your data and organize it into training and testing sets.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, and data augmentation techniques as needed.

## Testing

Evaluate the model on test data using the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```

## Results

Provide details about the model's performance, accuracy, and any relevant metrics.

## Usage

To use the model for face mask detection on individual images, you can follow the example in the [usage.py](usage.py) file. Make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly.

```bash
python usage.py
```
